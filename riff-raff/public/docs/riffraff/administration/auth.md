Authentication and Authorisation
================================

Authentication
--------------

Authentication is handled by Google. This obtains the users full name and e-mail address and both of these are used to 
provide an audit trail of deployments and other actions in the app.

Google auth is implemented in two layers
- Load Balancer layer: this component is defined in [the main riff raff cloudformation template](https://github.com/guardian/deploy-tools-platform/blob/main/cloudformation/riffraff/riffraff.template.yaml) and uses [authenticate-oidc](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/listener-authenticate-users.html#configure-user-authentication). It relies on an OAuth2 Client secret stored in Secrets Manager.
- Application layer: this layer uses The Guardian's [Play Google Auth Module](https://github.com/guardian/play-googleauth) and relies on the same OAuth2 Client secret which is defined in the main [application.conf](https://github.com/guardian/riff-raff/blob/afb7e602e11acd7a07aae433c74be22976d8a7cd/riff-raff/conf/application.conf#L40-L41) stored in S3.

To rotate the OAuth2 Client secret we recommend a workflow that minimises risk by making it easy to perform a rollback until the very last step. At a high level, it consists of creating a new secret while keeping the old one active, switching the application to the new one, and only then disabling and deleting the old secret.

Here is a step-by-step guide, which we recommend following first for the CODE environment and then on PROD:
1. (PROD only) Send a message about this rotation in the DevX Chat channel; this encourages people to report any unexpected problems to us quickly.
1. Create a new Client Secret in [Riff Raff's Google Cloud project](https://console.cloud.google.com/auth/clients?project=guardian-riff-raff) and leave the old secret in place.
1. Patch the application.conf file stored in the deploy tools config S3 bucket to use the new secret.
1. Update `/${STAGE}/deploy/riff-raff/clientSecret` in AWS Secrets Manager. As Secrets Manager is versioned, the new secret will be available as the most recent version with a given id.
1. Update the [secret version id for the relevant stage](https://github.com/guardian/deploy-tools-platform/blob/04591aa388c08c66a71461189c33add0b0cd4aa9/cloudformation/riffraff/riff-raff.yaml#L15-L19). For `CODE` updates, you will need to deploy the `tools::riffraff-cloudformation` project manually. For `PROD` updates, merging your PR will automatically trigger a [deployment to update the infrastructure](https://riffraff.gutools.co.uk/deployment/history?projectName=tools%3A%3Ariffraff-cloudformation&stage=PROD&pageSize=20&page=1).
1. Use Riff Raff to deploy itself, which will re-run the application startup routine (including loading the updated `application.conf`) while keeping the same instance alive. (Note: when it comes to this process we use Riff Raff CODE to deploy CODE, and PROD to deploy PROD.)
1. At this point both layers of authentication should be using the new secret, so you can disable the old credentials in the Google Cloud Project. (Note that GCP does not guarantee that disabling an existing credential is instant. It is unlikely, but it might take up to several hours in the worst case.)
1. Log into Riff Raff via an Incognito window to confirm that logging in (via both layers of auth) still works with the new secret. An issue with the load balancer layer will prevent any of Riff Raff's HTML from being presented, so you might be served a `561 Authentication Error` directly from the load balancer or an error page from Google Auth. An issue at the application layer may show up as an in-application error, such as a red banner saying `Login failure. Internal error, please check logs for more information`.
1. Delete the old credentials in Riff Raff's Google Cloud project.

Authorisation
-------------

There are a few different levels of authorisation.

The first level checks that the user is part of the Guardian organisation. This check actually runs at the load balancer
layer _and_ the application layer[^1]. Users who are not part of the Guardian organisation won't be able to reach Riff-Raff's
login screen.

The second level checks that the user has 2-factor auth enabled. Any user who is part of the Guardian organisation and
has 2-factor auth enabled will be able to login to Riff-Raff.

However, we also provide a third level of authentication that runs whenever users attempt to use any of Riff-Raff's
functionality. This third level checks that a user is in at least one authorised Google Group. Users who do not meet the
Google Group requirements will be unable to use Riff-Raff's functionality. For more details on the allowed list of Google
Groups, see [this doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1N8tCVRHVVctHVRBwpeiIppKHnUVwcX6zD6OJAJBsUXI/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.10257g8spha5).

Note that this third level relies on a (secret) service account key. This is completely separate from the OAuth2 Client secret
mentioned above and these can be rotated independently of each other.

Our `CODE` and `PROD` environments use separate service account keys. We recommend rehearsing the rotation in `CODE` first
and then repeating the process in `PROD`.

Here is a step-by-step guide for rotating the service account key:

1. (`PROD` only) Send a message about this rotation in the DevX Chat channel; this encourages people to report any unexpected problems to us quickly.
1. Select the relevant service account from [Riff-Raff's Google Cloud project](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts?project=guardian-riff-raff)
   and view its keys.
1. Add a new key (select JSON as the type).
1. Copy and paste the new key into the `/${STAGE}/deploy/riff-raff/service-account-cert` parameter in Parameter Store.
1. Use Riff Raff to deploy itself, which will re-run the application startup routine (including loading the new parameter value) while keeping the same instance alive. (Note: when it comes to this process we use Riff Raff CODE to deploy CODE, and PROD to deploy PROD.)
1. Deploy something else with Riff-Raff to confirm that the Google Group checks still run as expected.
1. Delete the old service account key in Riff Raff's Google Cloud project.

[^1]: These checks rely on the same OAuth2 Client secret that we use for authentication and the rotation process for this
secret is described above.
